    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most traditional breakfasts of the Balkan region is Ka훾amak, or cornmeal porridge. As with most dishes, different parts of the Balkans have different names for it. In some regions, it's referred to as Pura, and in Macedonia it's called Bakrdan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (470 ml) water</li>
        <li>1 cup (150 g) yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon (2-5 g) salt + more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (30 g) butter</li>
        <li>Feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan or soup pot, bring the water, butter, and salt to a boil.</li>
        <li>When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat slightly and slowly pour in the cornmeal. Whisk continuously until the cornmeal is well incorporated. Add in some or all of the feta cheese, whatever you prefer.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking the mixture for another 1-2 minutes until it has thickened.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately. Garnish with any remaining feta cheese or any of the traditional toppings listed above.</li>
